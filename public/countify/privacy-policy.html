      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you use our application(s), we collect the following information if you choose to provide us with access or permission: 
      </p>

      <p>
        • Geolocation Information. We may request access or permission to track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our mobile application(s), to provide certain location-based services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings. 
      </p>

      <p>
        • Mobile Device Access. We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's storage, calendar, camera, and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings. 
      </p>

      <p>
        • Push Notifications. We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes. All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We also automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The information we collect includes:  
      </p>

      <p>
        • Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps'), and hardware settings). 
      </p>

      <p>
        • Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information. 
      </p>

      <p>
        • Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We also use Google API services and obtain information from there. Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. 
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem
        accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab
        illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt
        explicabo.
      </p>

      <h2>When & With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may need to share your personal information in the following situations: 
      </p>

      <p>
        • Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. 
      </p>

      <p>
        • Affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honour this Privacy Notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Business Partners. We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions. 
      </p>

      <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years. 
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. 
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
